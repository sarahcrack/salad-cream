      <h3>What is Salad Cream?</h3>
      <p>
        Salad cream was the first product developed by Heinz specifically for
        the UK market and took eight years to perfect, finally appearing in
        grocers' shops in 1914. <br />
        After a century of being a must-have ingredient in lunchboxes and picnic
        hampers up and down the country, Salad Cream is still the 'Original
        Tangy Taste' that makes it one of Britain's best-loved sauces. You can
        of course spruce up your salad, but you can also boost those burgers,
        add zest to your chicken breast and reinvent the traditonal egg 'mayo'
        sandwich with a delicious dollop of Salad Cream.

      <h3>Salad Cream vs. Mayonnaise ðŸ¤”</h3>
      <p>
        Like mayonnaise, salad cream contains egg yolks, vegetable oil and
        mustard - but the principal difference lies in the amount of vinegar, as
        well as the water, which helps to thin down the sauce to a pouring
        consistency. There is an age-old debate as to whether salad cream or
        mayonnaise is the tastiest - what do you think?
